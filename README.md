#  CorA Dataset for coronary artery labeling
## Background
Building upon the ImageCAS dataset, we constructed a coronary artery dataset comprising 100 volumetric scans. Each case was manually annotated into 15 anatomically defined categories, including:

* proximal right coronary artery (pRCA),
* mid right coronary artery (mRCA),
* distal posterior coronary artery (dPCA),
* left main coronary artery (LM),
* proximal left circumflex artery (pLCX),
* obtuse marginal branch 1 (OM1),
* distal left circumflex artery (dLCX),
* obtuse marginal branch 2 (OM2),
* left posterior descending artery (LPDA),
* ramus intermedius (RI),
* proximal left anterior descending artery (pLAD),
* first diagonal branch (D1),
* mid left anterior descending artery (mLAD),
* second diagonal branch (D2), 
* distal left anterior descending artery (dLAD).

Compared with existing datasets, this collection provides fine-grained and anatomically comprehensive annotations of coronary artery substructures, thereby serving as a complementary benchmark for evaluating the generalizability and robustness of coronary artery labeling models.

To facilitate future research in fine-grained coronary artery analysis, we plan to publicly release this dataset.
