#  CorA Dataset for coronary artery labeling
## Background
Based on the ImageCAS dataset, we curated a private coronary artery dataset comprising 100 volumes. Each case is manually annotated into 15 anatomical categories, including the left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCX), right coronary artery (RCA), and their major branches. This dataset provides more detailed coronary artery structures, thereby serving as a complementary benchmark to validate the generalizability of our model. We plan to publicly release this dataset to facilitate future research in fine-grained coronary artery analysis. Similarly, we partitioned the data using a 6:2:2 ratio for training, validation, and test sets.
